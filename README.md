# Building-Rest-API
Building rest API to get Prediction values

• Now that you have completed the midterm, you have 3 models for regression and 3 models for classification. The goal of this assignment is to deploy your models into production using a machine learning as a service platform. We have chosen Azure ML for this.
• Deploy the 3 models for regression and 3 models for classification using Azure ML and create 6 REST APIs. You can use inbuilt algorithms or use your own Python/R code in blocks. You could also choose to train models you built for the midterm outside and just use Azure ML to deploy the trained algorithms. You could also choose to do the entire training from scratch using Azure ML
• Build a Web app using any programming language and illustrate how to use these REST Apis
• Deploy the web app on a cloud environment
• We should be able to invoke one of the six REST APIs deployed using Azure ML through your web app deployed on a cloud environment using a browser.
• Provide test cases so that we can replicate the test cases.
• Provide adequate documentation and source code so that we can replicate your setup.
